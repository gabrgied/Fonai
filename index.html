<h1>Stopping by Woods <span>on a Snowy Evening</span></h1>
<p>Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.
</p>
<div class="line"></div>
<p>He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other soundâ€™s the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
